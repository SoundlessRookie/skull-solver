# Skull Solver
Learning and assist tool for Skull Finder, a Minesweeper variant

## To run from source
You must have Python (preferably 3.12) and pip installed.
This was tested on Windows 11 but should theoretically run just fine on Mac or Linux.

`cd` to the project's root directory (`skull-solver`)

For Windows:
`python -m venv venv`
`venv\Scripts\activate`
`python app.py`

For Mac or Linux:
`python3 -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`
`python3 app.py`
